The Untitled Frost Train Game is a 3D top-down resource management game.
The player controls a train that travels through a frozen wasteland.
The train is the only source of warmth in the game world, and the player must manage the train's resources to keep it running.
Many aspects need to be managed, including temperature, power, food, freshwater, and people on the train who keep it running.
The player assumes full control over the policies of the train, but needs to keep the people on the train happy to avoid a mutiny.
The movement of the train is normally automated, and the player can control the train's speed to save power.
At certain junctions, the player can choose which path to take, which may lead to different events and resources.
The player can also choose to stop at certain locations to gather resources, but this will cost time and fuel.
During the game, key persons will advise the player on what to do, and the player can choose to follow their advice or not.
